# Testomania 
- 😎 This App's main purpose is to demonstrate code excellence for android with
  clean architecture and modern latest libraries and components.
  On the other hand, this App is useful to kill time while learning new things.
  App's code is open source and everyone can contribute, add his own category, fix bugs, or add features.
- 💡 Our ideology is that all the controls should be as below as possible in the thumb-reaching range space 
  and all the information should be on the upper side of the screen, to avoid hand shifting while using the App, 
  so this will explain our UI decisions :D and we will try to follow this ideology as much as possible.

- Enjoy and have fun 🤘
